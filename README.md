# SportAgain


#### What is this?
SportAgain is my first Android project using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Jetpack Compose is newest UI toolkit for Android that is officially recommended by Google for building native UI. 
It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Even though Jetpack Compose support interoperability between conventional android views (using xml), 
entire UI logic for this project is developed using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (so, <b>no more XMLs and complex views</b>). 
This project's main features are to show list of sports with it's detailed description and save user's favorite sports into local DB. 
Feel free to explore an fork the repo if you are also interested with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). ðŸ˜‰
